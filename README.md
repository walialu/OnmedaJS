The Onmeda JavaScript Library

This is the JavaScript library we use since the relaunch.

It is a working draft. It is not pretty, nor polished. It's a bit hacky and
whacky, but it works for our needs.

We might consider moving functions / methods around in the future (when we have
more time; hahaha, this might never happen)..
